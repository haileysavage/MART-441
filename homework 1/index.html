        <p>Hi, I'm Hailey Savage, a senior majoring in Management Information Systems at the University of Montana. I plan to graduate in May and hope to work at a web design agency. Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, coloring and spending time with my cat and dog.</p>

        <h2>Game Memory</h2>
        <p> Growing up we were always playing board games, I have two other siblings and we're all super competitive so playing games was always fun. One of my favorite memories is playing Monopoly with my siblings after the power went out. The game quickly turned competitive as we traded properties and plotted to bankrupt one another. I remember my brother losing almost all his money after landing on three of my properties in a row and then getting up in the middle of the game and leaving. Monopoly taught me patience, strategy, and the value of financial planning, all wrapped in a fun and chaotic package.</p>

        <h2>Games and the World</h2>
        <p>When I look at the world, I see endless opportunities for growth and innovation. However, I believe one of the most pressing issues we face today is a lack of empathy and understanding. Games like Monopoly, though simple, remind us of the importance of connection and strategic thinking. I believe games can help us tackle global challenges by teaching us to collaborate, communicate, and think critically about the decisions we make and their long-term consequences.</p>
