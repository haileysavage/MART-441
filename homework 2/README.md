# Reflection of Generative AI

## What I Created

For this assignment, I created a simple web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The web page features:
- A light blue background color set using a style element within the <head> of the document
- A welcoming title and an image displayed on the page
- A console logs for:
    - Three favorite websites
    - Three favorite games
    - Three favorite artists, including their cultural importance
- A prompt that asks the user for their favorite color and logs the response to the console

## Comparison with Copilot's Output

Copilot's code generation was similar to what I wrote but:
1. **Structure and Readability**: 
    - It provided clean and concise output without adding unnecessary complexity
    - The styling was minimal but sufficient, matching the requirements closely.

2. **Content**:
    - Copilot used placeholders for the image and specific websites, games, and artists. These suggestions were generic but functional.

3. **Functionality**: 
    - The prompt and logging functionality matched my version closely, showing a clear alignment with the assignment requirements.

## Reflection on Using Generative AI Models

If I had relied solely on the output from Copilot, I think the results would have been:

1. **Adequacy of Explanation**:
    - I could explain the generated code because the model provides clear, structure, and commented output. However, there might be a slight learning curve if the code oncluded unfamilair concepts (advanced CSS techniques).

2. **Ownership of Work**:
    - While the work generated by AI models feels collaborative, there's a sense that it isn't entirely "mine" if I only copy-paste the output without modifcations. Personalizing the content and adapting it to fit my style makes it feel more like my work.

3. **Learning and Creativity**:
    - Using AI for guidance fosters learning, especially when comparing its suggestions with my own ideas. However, relying too heavily on AI could limit my creativity and problem-solving abilities in the long run.

## Conclusiom

Overall, I found the process of comparing my work with AI-generated suggestions valuable. Copilot provided excellent starting points, and by integratinf my ideas, I created a project that felt uniquely mine. Generative AI is a helpful tool, but it's essential to engage with the code, understand it, and make it your own to grow as a developer.
